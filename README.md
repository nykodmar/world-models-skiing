# World Models skiing

In this project I applied a [World Models](https://worldmodels.github.io/) framework (from the paper of Ha and Schmidhuber) to a Skiing environment as a practical part of my bachelor thesis.  

To understand individual parts of the framework read  the paper mentioned above or in more detail in my [thesis](thesis.pdf).  

The implementation is in a jupyter notebook [world_models_skiing.ipynb](world_models_skiing.ipynb). 

For replicating the results please follow [instructions.md](instructions.md).

In a folder [pictures](/pictures) you are some visualization from the progress.
